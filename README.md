Test-Driven Software Development emphasizes writing tests before the actual code and coming up with different types of test cases for a feature to ensure that it works to a minimum degree. 

# Pros:

Bug Detection: It helps us keep a set of basic test cases, such as the Happy Path, Negative Path, UI validation, and Corner cases. If these tests fail, we immediately know what's failing and can make the necessary changes. Additionally, by adding tests to identify existing bugs, we can diagnose them if they ever occur again. This makes bug detection very easy.

Regression Testing: It helps us test that functionality is intact when we are adding new features. It also reduces the chances of adding new bugs arising due to clashes between existing and new features.

# Cons:

Time-Consuming: It takes a lot of time to implement these tests, and once a test is created, the code review and code integration process can be time-consuming. This might be inefficient if we want to deliver features very quickly.

Test Maintenance: As the codebase grows larger, maintaining tests becomes challenging, and it can be hard to keep track of them. As our features evolve, we might need to change the tests as well, which can consume significant resources."
